# Motoko Bootcamp 2 - Building a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)


A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a blockchain-based organization where decisions are made collectively by participants through voting. It operates on smart contracts, enabling transparent and democratic decision-making without a central authority. Participants use tokens to vote on proposals, manage funds, and automate processes, fostering decentralized and trustless collaboration.

This project was carried out during the [Motoko Bootcamp](https://motokobootcamp.org)

To learn more before you start working with Dao, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd Motoko-Bootcamp-2/
npm install
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background --clean

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.
